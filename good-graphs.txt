What are the characteristics of a good data visualization/graph?  
Purpose - Meaningful data
Clean look, readable, not too busy-looking. 
Content should not cram too much data into it.
(ASIDE: Rule of 6 - gestalt
The idea that the human brain can't handle too many visual items that look the same. Think of ways to group items.)
Visually appealing - color, high colour contrast and large enough font-size for accessibility reasons, clean fonts.
Choose a type that conveys message accurately and in a way that's understandable.

Layout specifics - Titles that are understandable to the average person, that give context, perhaps add a caption if more info will be needed for the user to understand.
Axes if necessary (line graph, bar graph), Labelled if needed
Legend if needed.
Link to the source of the data.
