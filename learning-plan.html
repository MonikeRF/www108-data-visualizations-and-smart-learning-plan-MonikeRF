        <h3>S. Specific- what I would like to learn?</h3>
        <p>I would like to continue my education by looking into Javascript, Jquery and PHP night classes.
       This is a good skill to have because all designers seem to have this as a proper working knowledge</p>

        <h3>M. Measurable- How I will know I've been succesful in my learning?</h3>
        <p>When I feel confident about what I can produce, that they meet the industry standards; meaning that I can identify what most websites are producing and can reproduce them with certainty. </p>

        <h3>A. Achieveable- How will I achieve these goals?</h3>
        <p>I plan to learn as much as I can by classes, seminars, social meetups and good old fashioned reading. I have many resources now that I have taken this course; ie, my textbooks, Lynda.com, W3Cschools.com, and other various websites I've been privy to learning about while in this course- I'm very grateful! The only real obstacle I can see might be cost and time. Also, maybe, the decipline to keep searching and researching while on my own.</p> 

        <h3>R. Relevant- Why are these skills relevant in 2019?</h3>
        <p>Majority of websites have some form of Javascript and Jquery. Userabilty is very important in this market. Javascript and Jquery achieve most of those simple things that we have become accustomed to on the internet. PHP is necessary for the purpose that I would like to use it- wordpress! I have found that I really like wordpress and would like to pursue it.</p>

        <h3>T. Time-Bound- How long will it all take?</h3>
        <p>I would like to think that I can acheive proper confidence in these areas by Summer 2020, which is roughly this time next year.</p>
